I want to have a user login. After I log in, I want to be able to search up a restaurant near me. When I search up a restaurant, I want to 
see how busy it is right now, if outdoor seating is available/an option, covid numbers in the area, if people are serious about wearing 
masks and following guidelines, and information about how safe it is to eat at this restaurant in regards to risks with COVID-19 
(if it is a hotspot, cases are declining, cases are increasing, etc).
