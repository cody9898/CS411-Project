I want to have an option to see a heatmap view. App will show a map centered at user's current location. Map will show a gradient color overlay with a darker color representing areas of greater COVID risk. I can also search for locations and they will be shown on the map as pins. See user search story for what will be displayed after selecting a location on the heatmap.
